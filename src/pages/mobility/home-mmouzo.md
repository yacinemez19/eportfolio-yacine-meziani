As an Algerian student studying in France, I have already experienced the rewards and challenges of adapting to new environments. This journey has allowed me to grow both academically and personally, fostering resilience and a global perspective. I am particularly interested in pursuing an international mobility project in countries like Canada or the United States, where research in artificial intelligence and data science is exceptionally advanced. Not only would this opportunity immerse me in leading-edge research, but it would also enable me to improve my English and broaden my understanding of global approaches in technology. My background as an international student has shown me the value of embracing diverse perspectives, and I look forward to expanding my experience further in a multicultural setting.
