Cooking is one of my favorite creative outlets, allowing me to step away from studies and recharge. Italian cuisine is my go-to style, as it combines simplicity with a high level of mastery in ingredient preparation. Through cooking, I’ve learned patience and the satisfaction of refining my skills in an area that’s both relaxing and rewarding.
