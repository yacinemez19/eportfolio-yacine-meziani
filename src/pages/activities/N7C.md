I am eager to join N7 Consulting, the ENSEEIHT junior enterprise, which operates as a small consulting firm managed by students. This experience would give me a chance to develop essential soft skills, work on a large-scale project, and collaborate with other motivated students. The opportunity to enhance my teamwork abilities while contributing to real-world projects is a major reason for my interest in joining.
