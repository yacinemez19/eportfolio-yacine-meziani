During my time in preparatory classes, I took up fitness as a regular activity and eventually became responsible for the campus gym. This role allowed me to ensure the gym’s availability for myself and other students, giving me more opportunities to train consistently. Fitness has been instrumental in helping me build discipline and maintain a strong physical and mental balance, especially under the demands of my studies.
