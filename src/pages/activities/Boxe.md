 I am an active member of the Fight7Club boxing team at ENSEEIHT, where I train regularly. Boxing is a demanding sport that requires intense cardiovascular fitness and mental resilience. It has helped me strengthen my mental discipline and develop a strong spirit, as each session pushes me to my limits.
