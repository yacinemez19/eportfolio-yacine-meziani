Hello! I’m Yacine Meziani, an Algerian computer science and engineering student currently studying in France. Since I was a child, I've been captivated by computers and how they work; pursuing a career in this field has always been my goal. At 18, I moved to France to enroll in an intensive preparatory program for top engineering schools, aiming to deepen my technical knowledge and ultimately become an engineer.

Today, I’m especially fascinated by artificial intelligence, particularly the rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs). I’m drawn to applied AI and data science, and I’m considering the possibility of pursuing a PhD in this exciting field.
