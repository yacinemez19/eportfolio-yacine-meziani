Driven by a goal to join a specialized engineering school in computer science, I entered the prépa des INP in Toulouse, a rigorous program aimed at developing both technical expertise and academic discipline. Over two intensive years, I enhanced my skills in mathematics, physics, and computer science, as well as English and Spanish, gaining a solid scientific foundation crucial for an engineering career.

The atmosphere in the program was highly motivating, with supportive professors and a collaborative spirit among classmates, all contributing to a dynamic and challenging learning environment. This experience helped me cultivate essential qualities such as discipline, resilience under pressure, and a continuous work ethic, alongside a growing appreciation for the pursuit of excellence.

Additionally, a lab internship at IRIT confirmed my interest in artificial intelligence, guiding me toward a specialized path in this field.
