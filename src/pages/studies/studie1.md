After completing two years in the INP preparatory program, known for its intensive, multidisciplinary approach across scientific and technical fields, I was admitted to ENSEEIHT through a competitive examination. I am currently focused on the Electronics, Electrical Energy, and Automation track. ENSEEIHT also offers the ModIA program, a specialized track in applied AI and data science, which aligns with my career interests. I am eager to join this program as it offers an alternating work-study format, allowing me to gain practical experience alongside advanced academic study
